## Docker [:link:](https://docs.docker.com/)

### Docker Desktop [:link:](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
Docker is a full development platform for creating containerized applications. 
[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) is the best way to get started with Docker on Windows.

### Docker Compose [:link:](https://docs.docker.com/compose)
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
